            <b>Choosing a Bitcoin wallet</b><br>
            First of all to send and receive bitcion you are going to need a bitcion wallet.
            A bitcoin wallet is a device or program that stores your private keys, and allows
            you to interact with the bitcoin blockchain. To send and receive bitcion you need 
            some sort of a program to do");

            This unique address is called your bitcoin address, and you can share it with anyone who
            wants to send you bitcoins.  Once you have your address the wallet chooses your password 
            randomly for you. This password is called your private key it should never be shared with 
            anyone. it is good  to write it down on a piece of paper or keep it on a flash drive that’s 
            disconnected from the Internet.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are many different wallets across various platforms. While they all share certain basic 
            functionality, features vary from one wallet to the other. Bitcoin wallet programs are 
            available for  mobile phones, desktops, web, and even as a standalone piece of hardware or 
            paper wallets.
